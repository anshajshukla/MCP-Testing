    "summary": "The application exhibits a significant test failure rate, with particularly high failures in the Security module, coupled with slow test execution and a concerning pattern of failed tests across multiple categories.  This points towards a potential vulnerability or misconfiguration impacting core functionality.",

The sustained high failure rate across multiple modules needs immediate attention to ensure a stable and secure application.",
    "recommendations": [
      "Immediately investigate the 'SEC-001' failure - conduct a detailed analysis of the specific test case and its root cause.  Focus on the OTP timeout issue and investigate potential database connectivity problems or incorrect test environment setup. Implement a rollback strategy to quickly revert to a stable state.",
      "Review and update the security modules to ensure adherence to the latest security best practices. Specifically, verify the OTP timeout implementation and address any potential race conditions.  Conduct more comprehensive security testing, including penetration testing, to proactively identify vulnerabilities.",
      "Optimize the 'AI-SEC-001' and 'AI-PAY-001' test cases to improve test coverage and reduce execution time. Consider simplifying test scenarios, refining test data, or leveraging automated test frameworks to reduce execution time without compromising quality. Improve the coverage of the 'AI-SEC-002' test case by adding more scenarios.",
      "Investigate the slow test 'VAL-001' to determine the root cause and optimize its execution time. This could involve profile the test execution, identify bottlenecks, and improve the test environment setup."
