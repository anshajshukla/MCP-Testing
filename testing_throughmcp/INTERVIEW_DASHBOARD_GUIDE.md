```

## 🎤 Interview Narrative Flow

### 1. Opening Hook (30 seconds)
*"Let me show you our AI-powered banking test framework with a live dashboard that demonstrates how multiple AI agents work together to automate test creation and execution."*

**Show:** Pipeline status header with animated flow

### 2. Business Problem (1 minute)
*"Traditional banking testing is manual, time-consuming, and has limited coverage. Our system uses AI agents to automatically analyze gaps, generate tests, and provide insights."*

**Show:** KPI cards comparing baseline vs AI-generated tests
- Original: 7 manual tests
- AI-Generated: 30+ tests (371% increase)
- Pass rate: 87.9%

### 3. Technical Architecture (2 minutes)
*"This dashboard visualizes a 5-phase pipeline where specialized AI agents handle different aspects of test automation."*

**Walk through each tab:**

#### 🔍 Analyzer Agent
- **What it does:** "Analyzes existing test coverage and identifies gaps"
- **Show:** Gap analysis charts, missing scenarios by category
- **Key insight:** "AI identified 23 missing test scenarios across authentication, payments, and security"

#### ⚡ Generator Agent  
- **What it does:** "Creates new test cases using AI reasoning"
- **Show:** Generated test table, category breakdown
- **Key insight:** "AI authored comprehensive test cases covering edge cases humans typically miss"

#### 🚀 Executor Agent
- **What it does:** "Executes all tests and collects performance data"
- **Show:** Results table, pass/fail distribution, performance metrics
- **Key insight:** "Automated execution with detailed failure analysis and timing"

#### 📊 Result Analyzer
- **What it does:** "Combines statistical analysis with AI insights"
- **Show:** Failure patterns, AI recommendations
- **Key insight:** "AI identified authentication module as highest risk area"

### 4. Business Value (1 minute)
**Show Executive Summary tab:**
- 371% test coverage increase
- 100% automation
- Critical issue detection
- Actionable AI recommendations

### 5. Technical Deep Dive (2 minutes - if time)
- **Real Data:** "These are actual test results from our banking simulation"
- **AI Integration:** "Uses CrewAI + Ollama for local AI processing"
- **Scalability:** "Multi-agent architecture scales with complexity"
- **Export capability:** "All reports exportable for compliance"

## 🔧 Technical Talking Points

### Architecture Decisions
```python
# Multi-agent coordination
class TestOrchestrator:
    def execute_pipeline(self):
        gap_analysis = AnalyzerAgent().analyze()
        tests = GeneratorAgent().generate(gap_analysis)
        results = ExecutorAgent().execute(tests)
        insights = AnalyzerAgent().analyze_results(results)
        return insights
```

### AI Integration
- **Local LLM:** Ollama/Gemma for data privacy
- **Structured output:** JSON schemas for reliability
- **Domain-specific:** Banking terminology and scenarios

### Data Flow
```
Banking Scenarios → Gap Analysis → Test Generation → Execution → AI Insights → Dashboard
```
